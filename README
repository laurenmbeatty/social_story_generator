This is a project that I created for Prime Digital Academy.  Itâ€™s a social story generator application. A social story is used in the autism community to help people with autism understand changes in routine, behavior expectations, or perhaps an upcoming event that may be challenging. 

The user inputs text and urls for photos they would like to use. The final story is presented as a slideshow.
